  * energy conservation
  * sympletic integrators / Leap frog
  * close encounters / softening

  * look at Wisdom-Holman -- decomposes orbit into Keplerian part and interaction part.  See,
    e.g., https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/452/1/376/1748797

  maybe create fake RV data from a system with 4 planets (with some inclination)
  and try to recover their orbital periods?

  here's a nice fit to a line example: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.4686.pdf

* FFT

  for C++, consider using pocketFFT -- this is C++ header, and is used by NumPy
  https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/mtr/pocketfft/tree/cpp

  we can pass in the `.data()` of the underlying vector.

* Fitting an orbit:
