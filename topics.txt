* few body problem

  * energy conservation
  * sympletic integrators / Leap frog
  * close encounters / softening

  * look at Wisdom-Holman -- decomposes orbit into Keplerian part and interaction part.  See,
    e.g., https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/452/1/376/1748797

* autodiff
 
  do a very simple autodiff before machine learning

* reaction networks

  * stiff ODEs

* stellar structure

   * ODEs
   * shooting

* self-gravity

  * multipole method

* hydro

  * subgrid modeling with Burgers equation

* fitting

  * orthogonal distance regression: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/odr.html#module-scipy.odr


* bayesian

  maybe create fake RV data from a system with 4 planets (with some inclination)
  and try to recover their orbital periods?

  here's a nice fit to a line example: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.4686.pdf

       * better is galaxy10 from astroNN:

* FFT

  for C++, consider using pocketFFT -- this is C++ header, and is used by NumPy
  https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/mtr/pocketfft/tree/cpp

  we can pass in the `.data()` of the underlying vector.
