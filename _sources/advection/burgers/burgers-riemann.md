# Burgers' Riemann Problem

As discussed with advection, the physics of the equation comes into
play when we determine what the correct state is on the interface
given a left and right state.  This is the Riemann problem.  For Burgers'
equation, this Riemann problem is more complex.

## Shock speed

If the characteristics intersect in the $x$-$t$ plane, then it is not
possible to trace backwards in time to see where the information came
from&mdash;this is the condition of a shock.  The shock speed
is computed through the [_Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rankine%E2%80%93Hugoniot_conditions).

Consider the following space-time diagram:

A rightward moving shock in the $x$-$t$ plane separating two state
```

This shows a left and right state, $u_l$ and $u_r$, separated by a rightward
moving shock in the $x$-$t$ plane (the dark line). Notice that:

* At time $t^n$, the state in our integral $x \in [x_l, x_r]$ is entirely $u_r$.

* As time evolves (think about moving upward in this figure), the state becomes
  a mix of states $u_l$ and $u_r$.
  
* Finally at time $t^{n+1}$ the state is entirely $u_l$ in $x \in [x_l, x_r]$.

* The shock speed is clearly $S = \Delta x / \Delta t$ in this figure.

To determine the speed, we start with Burgers' equation in conservative form:

$$u_t = - [f(u)]_x$$

and integrate our conservation law over space and time (and normalize by $\Delta x$):

$$\frac{1}{\Delta x} \int_{x_l}^{x_r} dx \int_{t^n}^{t^{n+1}} dt u_t = - \frac{1}{\Delta x} \int_{x_l}^{x_r} dx \int_{t^n}^{t^{n+1}} dt [f(u)]_x$$

Recognizing that at $t = t^n$, $u = u_r$ and at $t = t^{n+1}$, $u = u_l$, the left side becomes:

$$\frac{1}{\Delta x} \int_{x_l}^{x_r} \left \{ u(t^{n+1}) - u(t^n) \right \} dx = u_l - u_r$$

Now for the right side.  We see that all along $x = x_l$, the flux is $f = f(u_l)$ for $t \in [t^n, t^{n+1}]$.
Likewise, all along $x = x_r$, the flux is $f = f(u_r)$ in the same time interval.  Therefore, our expression becomes:

$$(u_l - u_r) = - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} \left [ f(u_r) - f(u_l) \right ]$$

Using $S = \Delta x/\Delta t$, we see:

$$S = \frac{f(u_r) - f(u_l)}{u_r - u_l}$$

and taking $f(u) = u^2 / 2$, we get the shock speed:

$$S = \frac{1}{2} (u_l + u_r)$$


## Sampling the solution

Now that we understand the shock speed, we need to determine what the state is on the interface.


For an interface in our domain, $u_{i+1/2}$, we need to solve the Riemann problem
$u_{i+1/2} = \mathcal{R}(u_{i+1/2,L}, u_{i+1/2,R})$.  We do this first by looking
at whether the flow is converging or diverging.  For converging flow, $u_{i+1/2,L} > u_{i+1/2,R}$, we need to consider a shock; otherwise we consider a rarefaction.
We write this as:

$$u_{i+1/2} = \mathcal{R}(u_{i+1/2,L}, u_{i+1/2,R}) = \left \{ \begin{array}{cc}
         u_\mathrm{shock} & \mbox{if}~ u_{i+1/2,L} > u_{i+1/2,R} \\
         u_\mathrm{rare} & \mbox{otherwise} \end{array} \right .
$$

where $u_s$ is the shock case and $u_r$ is the rarefaction case.

For the shock, we look at the direction the shock is moving and choose the appropriate state:

$$u_\mathrm{shock} = \left \{ \begin{array}{cc}
     u_{i+1/2,L} & \mbox{if}~ S > 0 \\
     u_{i+1/2,R} & \mbox{if}~ S < 0 \end{array} \right .
$$

For the rarefaction, we do:

$$u_\mathrm{rare} = \left \{ \begin{array}{cc}
     u_{i+1/2,L} & \mbox{if}~ u_{i+1/2,L} > 0 \\
     u_{i+1/2,R} & \mbox{if}~ u_{i+1/2,R} < 0 \\
     0           & \mbox{otherwise} \end{array} \right .
$$
