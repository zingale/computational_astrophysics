# Burgers' Equation

The [inviscid Burgers' equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgers%27_equation#Inviscid_Burgers'_equation) is the simplest nonlinear wave
equation, and serves as a great stepping-stone toward doing full
hydrodynamics.

$$u_t + u u_x = 0$$

```{important}
This looks like the linear advection equation, except the quantity
being advected is the velocity itself.  This means that $u$ is no
longer a constant, but can vary in space and time.
```

Written in conservative form, 

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial F(u)}{\partial x} = 0$$

it appears as:

$$u_t + \left [ \frac{1}{2} u^2 \right ]_x = 0$$

so the flux is $F(u) = \frac{1}{2} u^2$.

In the finite volume approach, we integrate over the volume of a cell
to get the update:

$$\frac{\partial \langle u \rangle_i}{\partial t} = - \frac{1}{\Delta x} (F_{i+1/2} - F_{i-1/2})$$

To second order accuracy, as we saw previously, $\langle u \rangle_i
\approx u_i$, so we'll drop the $\langle \rangle$ here.

```{important}
By solving Burgers' equation in integral form (which is what the finite-volume
approach does), we avoid needing to discretize $\partial u/\partial x$ directly,
which may be undefined if $u$ is discontinuous.

## Nonlinear behavior

Our solution method is essentially the same, aside from the Riemann
problem.  We still want to use the idea of upwinding, but now we have
a problem&mdash;the nonlinear nature of the Burgers' equation means
that information can "pile up" and we lose track of where the flow is
coming from.  This gives rise to a nonlinear wave called a shock.

For the linear advection equation, the solution was unchanged along
the lines $x - ut = \mbox{constant}$&mdash;we called these the
[*characteristic curves*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_characteristics).

We can visualize the characteristics as show below:

```{figure} advection-characteristics.png
:align: center

The initial $a(x, t=0)$ state (top) and the
characteristic curves in the $x$-$t$ spacetime diagram (bottom).  We see that
at any $t > 0$, we find the value of $a(x, t)$ by simply tracing
backwards along the characteristic curve to the initial conditions.
Since $u$ is constant in the advection equation, the characteristic
curves are parallel.
```

The characteristic curves are the curves on which the solution is
constant.  For Burgers' equation, the characteristic curves are given
by $dx/dt = u$, but now $u$ varies in the domain.  To see this, look
at the change of $u$ in a fluid element (the full, or Lagrangian time
derivative):

$$\frac{du}{dt} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \frac{dx}{dt} \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} =
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0$$

We see that $du/dt = 0$ since it just gives us the Burgers equation.
So $u$ is constant along the curves $dx/dt = u$, but now $u$ varies in
the domain.  So if we look at the characteristic curves in the
spacetime diagram, we get:

:align: center

Converging characteristic curves for Burgers's equation resulting from
an initially non-uniform velocity.
```

Now we see that, for these initial conditions, at some point in the
future the characteristics intersect.  This means that there is not a
unique curve that we can trace back along to find the value of
$u(x,t)$.  The information about where the solution was coming from
was lost.  This is the situation of a *shock*.  

```{tip}
The correct solution at a shock is to put a discontinuous jump between the left and right states
where the characteristics intersect.  The speed of the shock can be
found from the [Rankine-Hugoniot conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rankine%E2%80%93Hugoniot_conditions).
```

It is also possible to get a *rarefaction* if the characteristics diverge:
