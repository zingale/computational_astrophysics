Linear Algebra
==============

Linear algebra, including solving a linear system of the form ${\bf
A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$ is at the heart of many
numerical applications.  Here we'll learn the basic methods to work with matrices.

Later, we'll use our numerical linear algebra when we discuss:

* Fitting to data

* Machine learning

* Diffusion problems

* Stiff ordinary differential equations / nuclear reaction networks
