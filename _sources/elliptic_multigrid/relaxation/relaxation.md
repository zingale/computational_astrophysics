# Relaxation

A second-order accurate discretization of the second derivative is:

$$\phi_i^{\prime\prime} = \frac{\phi_{i+1} - 2\phi_i + \phi_{i-1}}{\Delta x^2}$$

```{tip}
This is true on finite-difference and finite-volume grids (to second-order in $\Delta x$).
```

We'll work in 1-d.  Our
Poisson equation

$$\phi^{\prime\prime} = f$$

becomes:

$$\frac{\phi_{i+1} - 2\phi_i + \phi_{i-1}}{\Delta x^2} = f_i$$


Using this discretization for all zones i in $0, \ldots, N-1$ results
in $N$ coupled algebraic equations.

```{note}
We could solve this by writing it as a linear system,
${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$, with ${\bf A}$ a triadiagonal matrix with
diagonals $1, -2, 1$ and $b$ corresponding to $f_i$.  This approach is a
"direct solve" of the coupled system.  But this can be expensive in
multi-dimensions and harder to parallelize if [domain decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_decomposition_methods) is used.
```

Instead of directly solving the linear system, we can use
[relaxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_(iterative_method))&mdash;an
iterative approach that converges to the solution.

We solve for the update for a single zone:

$$\phi_i = \frac{1}{2} ( \phi_{i+1} + \phi_{i-1} - \Delta x^2 f_i ) $$

and then iteratively use this expression to update the zones one by one.


```{tip}
Relaxation is often also called _smoothing_ because the trend is to make
the solution smoother as we iterate.
```

Generally relaxation requires that the matrix be [*diagonally
dominant*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonally_dominant_matrix),
which we are just shy of, but nevertheless, relaxation works quite
well for this system.

## Smoothing types

There are a few popular approaches we can
consider:

* [*Jacobi iteration*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_method) :
  * pick an initial guess $\phi_i^{(0)}$ for all $i$
  * Improve the guess via relaxation:

    $$\phi_i^{(k+1)} = \frac{1}{2} ( \phi_{i+1}^{(k)} + \phi_{i-1}^{(k)} - \Delta x^2 f_i )$$

  * Assess the error, and if needed iterate

* [*Gauss-Seidel (G-S) iteration*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Seidel_method) :

  * pick an initial guess $\phi_i^{(0)}$ for all $i$

  * use the new data as it becomes available:

    $$\phi_i \leftarrow \frac{1}{2} ( \phi_{i+1} + \phi_{i-1} - \Delta x^2 f_i )$$

    Note that there are no iteration superscripts indicated here,
    since we are not keeping the old and new $\phi$ separate in
    memory.  We keep only a single $\phi$ and update it as we sweep
    from $i = 0, \ldots, N-1$.

* *Red-black Gauss-Seidel*: this is a variation on G-S iteration that does the update
  of the odd and even zones separately.  The name comes from thinking about a checkerboard:
  with our update, the black squares depend only on the red and the red squares depend only
  on the black.  So we can update them in 2 separate passes.

  * First update the odd points&mdash;they only depend on the values at
    the even points

  * Next update the even points&mdash;they only depend on the values of
    the odd points

  The advantage of this is that it makes it much easier to parallelize
  via domain decomposition.  We'll use this approach going forward.

```{note}
We already saw how to solve this type of boundary value problem using
[shooting](https://zingale.github.io/computational_astrophysics/ODEs/boundary-value-problems.html),
so why are we redoing it now using an iterative process?

The answer is that shooting only works for a 1D Poisson equation, but relaxation extends
easily to 2- and 3D.  We will also see that there is a powerful technique called _multigrid_
that can accelerate the convergence of relaxation.
```

## Boundary conditions

We need to pay special attention to the boundaries.  This depends on
what type of grid we are using.

For a finite difference (node-centered) grid:

![finite-difference grid](fd_grid_bnd.png)

we have a point exactly on each boundary, so we only need to iterate
over the interior points.

In contrast, for a finite-volume or cell-centered finite-difference grid:

![finite-volume grid](ccfd_grid_bnd.png)

we don't have data on the physical boundaries, so we will need to
interpolate to the boundary.

We'll work with a cell-centered grid, with a single ghost cell (needed
to set the boundary conditions).  We'll label the first interior zone
as `lo` and the last interior zone as `hi`.  Imagine that the domain
runs from $[a, b]$.

![cell-centered finite difference grid with labels](ccfd_ghost.png)

Consider the following boundary conditions:

* Dirichlet: we need the value on the boundary itself to satisfy the
  boundary condition:

  $$\phi(a) = A$$

  ```{caution}
  A naive guess would be to set $\phi_{\mathrm{lo}-1} = A$, but this
  is only first order accurate.
  ```

  We recognize that we can average across the boundary to be
  second-onder on the boundary:

  $$A = \frac{\phi_\mathrm{lo} + \phi_\mathrm{lo-1}}{2}$$

  which gives the ghost cell value:

  $$\phi_{\mathrm{lo}-1} = 2 A - \phi_\mathrm{lo}$$


* Neumann: we need a gradient, centered at the boundary to match the
  given value:

  $$\phi^\prime(a) = C$$

  A second-order accurate discretization on the boundary is:

  $$C = \frac{\phi_\mathrm{lo} - \phi_\mathrm{lo-1}}{\Delta x}$$

  so we would initialize the ghost cell as:

  $$\phi_{\mathrm{lo}-1} = \phi_\mathrm{lo} -\Delta x C$$
