# Diffusion

The [diffusion equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_equation) is

$$\phi_t = k \phi_{xx}$$

In astrophysics, this can describe thermal diffusion, where $\phi$
is temperature, diffusion of photons, where $\phi$ is the photon
energy density, mass diffusion, where $\phi$ is the concentration
of a particular species, or viscosity, where $\phi$ is velocity.

Physically, diffusion takes a strongly-peaked concentration of $\phi$
and spreads it out.  And initial discontinuities are quickly smeared out.
We can derive this via [Fick's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fick's_laws_of_diffusion)
which says that the diffusive flux is proportion to the gradient of the quantity 
diffusing:

$$F = -k \nabla \phi$$

where the "$-$" sign indicates that diffusion flows from high concentration
to low concentration.


```{note}
More generally, the diffusion coefficient, $k$, can depend on
position (or even $\phi$), and we could write the diffusion equation
as:

$$\phi_t = \left [ -k \phi_x \right ]_x$$

We'll assume that $k$ is constant here.  In this form, this is also
called the
[heat equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation).
```

Solving the diffusion equation requires initial conditions and two
boundary conditions.


## (An) Analytic solution

Testing a numerical solution of the diffusion equation is easier if we
have an analytic solution.  A nice property of the diffusion equation
is that a Gaussian initial profile diffuses as a wider, lower amplitude
Gaussian:

$$\phi^a(x,t) = (\phi_2 - \phi_1) \left ( \frac{t_0}{t + t_0} \right )^{1/2}
e^{-\tfrac{1}{4} (x - x_c)^2/ k(t + t_0)} + \phi_1$$

Here, $t_0$ is a small time.  In the limit that $t_0 \rightarrow 0$,
we get a delta-function for the initial condition.

```{note}
This is a solution of the 1D diffusion equation.  For 2 and 3D, the 
solution is slightly different.
```

If we look at the evolution of this Gaussian, we see:

This shows the expected behavior&mdash;a strongly peaked concentration
of $\phi$ spreads out with time.
