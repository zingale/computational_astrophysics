More Applications
=================

There are a lot of other processes in astrophysics that are described
by a system of ODEs.  Here are some suggestions to explore.

1. _Trojan asteroids in the Sun-Jupiter system._

   The [trojan
   asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_trojan) share the
   same orbit as Jupiter around the Sun, but lead or trail it in its
   orbit by 60 degrees.  These can have interesting orbits around the
   L4 and L5 Lagrange points.  This is also an example of the
   [_restricted 3-body
   problem_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem#Restricted_three-body_problem).
   To make the integration easier, we work in the rotating frame
   defined by Jupiter's orbital period.  Then Jupiter is stationary
   and we integrate the orbits of the Trojan asteroids.  Initial
   conditions for some interesting orbits have been worked out by
   [Rabe
   1961](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1961AJ.....66..500R/abstract)&mdash;see
   table I.  This topic is discussed extensively in the text by Paul
   Hellings.

2. _Halo orbits about the Sun-Earth L2 point._

   [JWST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope) orbits
   the Sun-Earth system's L2 point in a [halo orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_orbit).
   
   Create a model of this by solving the restricted three-body
   equations in the corotating frame for the Sun-Earth system.  The
   paper [Three-Dimensional Periodic "Halo"
   Orbits](https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1984CeMec..32...53H)
   by Kathleen Howell is a good starting point.

3. _Star formation in the Galaxy._

   The paper by [Bodifee
   1986](https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1986Ap%26SS.122...41B)
   works out a simple model for star formation in the Galaxy, tracking
   the gas and stellar mass history.
   This can show [limit cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_cycle) behavior, as
   explored in [Sharaf et al. 2012](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012JAsGe...1...70S/abstract).
   This topic is also discussed extensively in the text by Paul Hellings.


4. General relativistic orbits:

   * _Geodesics around a Schwarzschild black hole_

     The motion of a test particle in general relativity around a black hole of mass $M$
     described by the Schwarzschild metric leads to an ordinary differential equation.
     See the [Schwardzschild geodesics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_geodesics) Wikipedia
     article for references.

   * _Precession of Mercury_

     The orbit of Mercury precesses due to general relativistic effects.  This is
     nicely worked out in [KÃ¶rber et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01678.pdf).
