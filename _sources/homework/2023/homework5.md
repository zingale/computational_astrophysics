1. We are going to create a simple two-dimensional table of pressure
   (in terms of density and temperature) and interpolate from it to get the pressure
   at any thermodynamic point.

   We'll use a simple expression for pressure, but this will mimic what is done in
   real stellar evolution codes:

   $$P = \frac{k_B \rho T}{\mu_I m_u} + \frac{1}{3} a T^4 + K \left (\frac{\rho}{1~\mathrm{g~cm^{-3}}} \right )^{5/3} \mu_e^{-5/3}$$

   this is ideal gas for ions (first term), radiation (middle term), and non-relativistic electrons (last term).  The composition is specified by $\mu_I$
   (the mean molecular weight per ion) and $\mu_e$ (the mean molecular weight per electron).


   The values of the constants are:

   * $k_b = 1.38\times 10^{-16}~\mathrm{K}$ (Boltzmann's constant)
   * $a = 7.56\times 10^{-15}~\mathrm{erg~cm^{-3}}$ (radiation constant)
   * $\mu_I = 1.26$
   * $\mu_e = 1.15$
   * $m_u = 1.66\times 10^{-24}~\mathrm{g}$ (the atomic mass unit)
* $K = 10^{13}~\mathrm{erg~cm^{-3}}$

   Our goal is to create a two-dimensional table of pressure at discrete
   values of density and temperature.  We'll construct this in the following way:

   * Use $N_\rho$ points for density between $1~\mathrm{g~cm^{-3}}$ and $10^4~\mathrm{g~cm^{-3}}$, spaced equally logarithmically.

     ```{note}
     In most programming languages, the `log()` function is the natural log.  We want
     The base-10 log, so you'll want to use `log10()`
     ```
     
   * Use $N_T$ points for temperature between $10^6~\mathrm{K}$ and $10^8~\mathrm{K}$,
     spaced equally logarithmically.

   * Compute the pressure at each of those points.  This will create a grid that
     looks like below:

   Now we need to interpolate in two-dimensions.  Imagine that the orange "$\times$"
   is where we want to know the pressure.  We will use the 4 tabulated points surrounding it: $(\rho_i, T_j)$, $(\rho_{i+1}, T_j)$, $(\rho_i, T_{j+1})$, $(\rho_{i+1}, T_{j+1})$

   * Write our interpolating function as:

     $$P(\rho, T) = a (\rho - \rho_i)(T - T_j) + b (\rho - \rho_i) + c (T - T_j) + d$$

     This is called _bilinear interpolation_.
     Compute the 4 unknowns, $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ using the 4 data points surrounding
     our $\times$.

   * Write a function to return the interpolated value of pressure given $(\rho, T)$.
