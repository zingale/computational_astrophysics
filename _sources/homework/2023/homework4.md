# Homework 4

```{note}
You are free to discuss these questions with your classmates and on
our class slack, but you must write your own solutions, including your
own source code.

All code should be uploaded to Brightspace along with any analytic
derivations, notes, etc.

1. The [Hilbert matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_matrix), ${\bf H}$ is defined such
   that its elements are:

   $$H_{ij} = (i + j -1)^{-1}$$

   for $i = 1, \ldots, N$ and $j = 1, \ldots, N$.  This matrix is known to
   have a large condition number.  Here we will explore the influence of this
   by solving progressively larger linear systems.

   Define a vector:

   $${\bf x}^{(N)} = (0, 1, \ldots, N-1)^T$$

   and call the
   $N\times N$ Hilbert matrix ${\bf H}^{(N)}$.  Define the righthand
   side of a linear system simply as:

   $${\bf b}^{(N)} = {\bf H}^{(N)} {\bf x}^{(N)}$$

   Using Gaussian elimination (you can use my code on the website or a
   built-in version in whatever language you are using), solve the system

   $${\bf H}^{(N)} \tilde{\bf x} = {\bf b}^{(N)}$$

   for $N = 2, \ldots, 15$.

   Define the error in your solution as

   $$\epsilon = \max |\tilde{\bf x}  - {\bf x}^{(N)} |$$

   For what value of $N$ does this error become
   $\mathcal{O}(1)$?---i.e. even the first digit in your computed
   solution is wrong.

   ```{note}
   Some languages have a built-in routine to compute the
   condition number, if you can do so easily, compute the condition
   number of the matrix for each $N$ and comment on how this is
   reflected in your solution.

2. A convolution is defined as:

   $$(f \star g)(t) \equiv \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\tau) g(t - \tau) d\tau$$

   It is easy to compute this with FFTs, via the [_convolution theorem_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem):

   $$\mathcal{F}\{f \star g\} = \mathcal{F}\{f\} \, \mathcal{F}\{g\}$$

   Here $\mathcal{F}\{\}$ indicates _taking the Fourier transform_.
   That is the Fourier transform of the convolution of $f$ and $g$ is simply
   the product of the individual transforms of $f$ and $g$.  This allows us
   to compute the convolution via multiplication in Fourier space and then take
   the inverse transform, $\mathcal{F}^{-1}\{\}$, to recover the convolution
   in real space:

   $$f \star g = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\{ \mathcal{F}\{f\} \, \mathcal{F}\{g\}\}$$

   The file [`signal.txt`](signal.txt) contains data of a
   function polluted with noise.  We want to remove the noise to
   recover the original function.  The three columns in the file are:
   $x$, $f^\mathrm{(orig)}(x)$, and $f^\mathrm{(noisy)}(x)$.

   Consider the following kernel:

   $$q^\mathrm{gauss}(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}}\, e^{-\frac{1}{2} (x/\sigma)^2}$$

   You are free to choose the width of the Gaussian, $\sigma$.

   * Make the kernel periodic on the domain defined by the $x$ in
     the `signal.txt` file.  You can do this simply by left-right
     flipping the definitions above and applying them at the far end of
     the domain.

     Make sure that your kernel function is normalized by ensuring
     that it sums to $1$ on the domain.  You might need to sum up the
     values and divide by the sum.

   * Plot the noisy function, $f^\mathrm{(noisy)}(x)$, and the kernel together.

   * Take the FFT (or DFT) of $f^\mathrm{(noisy)}(x)$ and the FFT of the kernel and
     plot them.

   * Compute the convolution of $f^\mathrm{(noisy)}(x)$ and $q(x)$
     in Fourier space and transform back to real space, and plot the
     _de-noised_ function together with the original signal from
     the `signal.txt` (i.e., $f^\mathrm{(orig)}(x)$).

   * Experiment with the tunable parameter, $\sigma$,
     to see how clean you can get the noisy data and comment on what you see.

  This process is used a lot in image processing both to remove noise
  and to compensate for the behavior of cameras to sharpen images.  In image processing
  programs, this is what is done in the _Gaussian blur_ transform.
