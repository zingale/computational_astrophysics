You are free to discuss these questions with your classmates and on
our class slack, but you must write your own solutions, including your

## 1. Cepheid $P$-$L$ relation

The paper [Calibrating the Cepheid period-luminosity relation from the infrared surface brightness technique. I. The p-factor, the Milky Way relations, and a universal K-band relation](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011A%26A...534A..94S/abstract) (Storm et al. 2011) presents a table of [Cepheid variable stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheid_variable).  Cepheid's are useful in astronomy because there is a period-luminosity ($P$-$L$) relationship that allows them to be used as distance indicators.

The file [cepheids.txt](cepheids.txt) contains the data from Table 7 of that paper,
with a few stars commented out, because they were disregarded in the fit.  We will
concern ourselves with 3 columns:

* $\log P$ : the base-10 log of the period (in days)
* $M_k$ : the K-band absolute magnitude.
* $\sigma(m-M)$ : the uncertainty in the absolute magnitude due to the distance
  uncertainty.  We'll take this to be the uncertainty in $M_k$.

```{warning}
There are a few NaNs in the data file that represent missing data.  Depending on how you
read in the file you will need to deal with these.
```

```{admonition} Your task
* Use the generalized linear least squares method we did [in class](https://zingale.github.io/computational_astrophysics/fitting/generalized-linear-least-squares-tests.html) to fit the data to a line of the form:

  $$M = a (\log_{10}(P) - 1.0) + b$$

  (this is what is used for Table 8 in Storm et al. 2011).

  Find the values of $a$ and $b$.

* Plot the data together with the fit you found.

* Using the matrix ${\bf A}$ from the generalized linear least squares, we can
  estimate the errors in the fit parameters as:

  $${\bf C} = ({\bf A}^\intercal {\bf A})^{-1}$$

  and then the uncertainty on fit parameter $j$ is:

  $$\sigma_j = \sqrt{C_{jj}}$$

  This will require that you compute the inverse of ${\bf A}^\intercal {\bf A}$:

  * If you are using python, you can use `np.linalg.inv()`.

  * If you are using C++, I've added a function in `inverse.H` to the regression code
    from class that contains a function to compute the inverse.  See:

## 2. Tabulating Reaction Rates

Previously we looked at the [temperature sensitivity of the 3-$\alpha$ rate](https://zingale.github.io/computational_astrophysics/basics/diff-int/application-rate-temperature-sensitivity.html).  Now we want to tabulate this rate at a small number of temperature points and use cubic interpolation to approximate the rate.

The temperature-dependent portion of the rate takes the form:

$$\lambda(T) = 5.09\times 10^{11} T_8^{-3} e^{-44.027/T8}$$

where $T_8 = T/(10^8~\mathrm{K})$.

Imagine that we tabulate this at $N$ temperature points (equally spaced in log).
When we did Lagrange interpolation, we tried to fit a polynomial to all $N$ points.

Now instead, we will find the 4 points that are closest to our desired (log) temperature, $\log(T_0)$, 
and fit a cubic polynomial to those and evaluate the rate from this interpolant.

```{tip}
Usually this will be 2 on each side of $\log T_0$, but near the ends of
our data sampling, we might need to use 1 point on one side of $\log T_0$
and 3 on the other.
```

```{admonition} Your task
* Sample $\log\lambda$ at 10 temperatures equally spaced in log between
  $10^8~\mathrm{K}$ and $5\times 10^9~\mathrm{K}$.  This will give you 10
  pairs of the form $((\log T)_i, (\log\lambda)_i)$.  Note: $\log()$ here
  means base-10 logarithm.

* Now randomly pick 25 temperature values in the same range
  $[10^8~\mathrm{K}, 5\times 10^9~\mathrm{K}]$.  For each of these points,
  do the following:

  * Call the random temperature we are working with $T_0$.  This is where we
    want to approximate the value of $\lambda$ via interpolation.
    
    For this $T_0$, find the 4 points that are closest to $\log T_0$.  Call
    these $j$, $j+1$, $j+2$, $j+3$.  We will use the data at those 4 points
    to construct our cubic interpolation.

  * Construct the Lagrange polynomial passing through those 4 data points,
    $((\log T)_j, (\log\lambda)_j), \ldots, ((\log T)_{j+3}, (\log\lambda)_{j+3})$.
    and evaluate $\log\lambda_0$ corresponding to $\log T_0$.

    You can use the code from class as a starting point, but don't use a library
    (e.g. scipy).
  
  * Now compute the value of $\lambda_0$ from the original expression and compute
    the error 

* Report the largest error you observe for all 25 points you tried.
