    "\n",
    "We'll assume here that the discrete data we have is at equally spaced points, and we will treat cases 1 and 2 with the same methods.  However, note that in general, if you have the freedom to evaluate $f(x)$ at any $x$ (case 1), then you can usually get a far better estimate of the integral by carefully selecting the points to evaluate at, compared to using the same number of equally spaced points (see for instance [Gaussian quadrature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_quadrature))."
