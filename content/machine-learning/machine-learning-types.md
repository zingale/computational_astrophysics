# Types of Machine Learning

[Machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)
encompasses a wide range of algorithms.  A basic goal is to learn
about a dataset to allow the algorithm to make predictions.

Some popular methods (see the [Wikipedia page for nice descriptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#Models)) include:

* artificial neural networks : these mimic neurons and their
  connections in the brain and are trained on data to set weights
  that then allow us to make predictions.

* [decision trees](
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) : here
  the underlying data structure is a decision tree that uses branching to classify data.

* random forest regression : this is related to decision
  trees but uses multiple trees and averaging to make predictions.
